- The District Course Master is maintained by Student Services. It
contains information at the district level about ALL courses that are
available to the schools. It is important to understand the set up in
the District Course Master and how it affects each course. The
District Course Master is broken down by school type and defines for
each course number the allowable grading type, graduation requirements,
special ed, honors, etc.

    <b>For all secondary schools

access for teachers assigned to a course in this range. It provides
access for the teacher to see ALL progress reports for assigned
students.</b> Used for advisory, options, labs, etc. that teachers need to

courses taught at your school. The course must be defined for your
school before it can be added to your master schedule. Course
Definitions are maintained by the school registrar.

- Each teacher must have a defined Teacher ID for your school before
you can assign a class to them. The school Teacher ID is linked to the
teachers employee number in the employee master file. The link between
the employee number and courses is what generates class rosters to the
grade books and gives teachers their MyStudent access.
